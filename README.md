Arduino IDE Program for ESP8266 Countdown Timer

This project is a timer for my Temporary Immersion System (TIS) bioreactor.
If you're working on a similar bioreactor or any system with the same principle, you can use this code for your own timer.

Disclaimer:
This program is not 100% written by me. The HTML + CSS design and troubleshooting were actually done by GPT. :V
